# Tidymodels in R: Building Tidy Machine Learning Models

This repository contains a project focused on using the **Tidymodels** framework for building and evaluating machine learning models in R. It walks through the process of importing, exploring, preparing data, and building classification models, with a focus on model tuning and performance evaluation.

## Contents

- `Tidymodels_in_R_ML_script.Rmd`: The primary RMarkdown file that guides you through the process of developing, tuning, and evaluating a classification model using Tidymodels. This includes:
  - Data import and exploration
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model building and tuning
  - Evaluation of model performance

## Key Concepts Covered

**Data Preprocessing:**  
Handling and preprocessing data, including normalization and encoding, ensuring that the dataset is suitable for machine learning models.

**Model Building and Tuning:**  
Building classification models with **Tidymodels**, utilizing techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

**Model Training:**  
Training the model on the prepared data, using methods like **Random Forest** to predict outcomes.

**Evaluation Metrics:**  
Assessing model performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and other relevant metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the analysis, you will need the following dependencies installed:

- R version 4.0 or higher
- RStudio
- R Packages:
  - tidymodels
  - ggplot2
  - palmerpenguins
  - skimr

You can install these dependencies in R by running the following command:

```r
install.packages(c("tidymodels", "ggplot2", "palmerpenguins", "skimr"))
```

## Running the Analysis

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jencheng1/tidymodel.git
cd tidymodel
```

2. Open the project in RStudio by clicking on the `tidymodels.Rproj` file.

3. Run the script by opening the `Tidymodels_in_R_ML_script.Rmd` file in RStudio and follow the steps to preprocess the data, build, tune, and evaluate the machine learning models.
